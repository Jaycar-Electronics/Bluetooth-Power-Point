# Bluetooth Power Point

Control a collection of powerpoints with your phone app

![hero image](hero.jpg)

Here's a great project that lets you use your Smartphone (using Bluetooth) to turn on/off any appliance such as a TV, computer, table lamp, etc. directly from the power point without getting up off the couch or out of bed.

While it might seem simple, this project opens up the world of bluetooth possibilities for your future arduino projects.
